# Daniel Briechle - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I set out to build a foundation for myself upon which to build a career. My goals hinged
upon deeply understanding the concepts rather than upon the grades. I am a big picture
thinker and early on I predominately struggled with fitting all the pieces of what I
was learning into that frame work. I found that focusing on concepts like storing rich
ruby objects and using helper methods aided me tremendously in tying everything into
a solid foundation. Technical aspects aside I feel I've also developed a greater
understanding of what it takes to be a good teammate and how to learn from others
while working toward a common goal.

## Projects

My favorite project was Black Thursday. While it got off to a rocky start it showed me
how successful a team can be if they regularly DTR and practice agile principles. I also
thoroughly enjoyed Enigma. Enigma helped to solidify the TDD process and to better
understand how to integrate it into agile. This practice lifted a the tremendous weight
of the unknown off of me and helped me to be a more confident and calm developer. In my
independent projects I learned how to ask for help. Sorting Cards was my least favorite
project because I felt constantly lost and didn't have the courage to ask for help. In my
later paired projects I learned the necessity of team work.

## Community

I'm an introverted person and assimilating into the community was at first difficult for me.
I found that as I opened up more, more people opened up to me. I have enjoyed getting to
know my classmates. Our conversations, whether they be coding or not, have helped me to
feel comfortable amongst the group and I feel their comfort around me. While I have done
the dishes in the kitchen a few times and volunteered to check our room for cleanliness,
I feel that the building of this community has superseded those janitorial efforts.

Next mod I would like to engage with my community outside of campus. While I was an
active participant on campus I did not make the greatest effort to put my laptop down
and join my cohort-mates after school. This is something that I will make a concerted effort
towards next module.
